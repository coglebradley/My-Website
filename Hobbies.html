        <p style="text-align: center;">Here is a couple of images of the things I like to do. A hobby of mine that has been around for as long as I can remember is my love for video games. <br> I have always been invested into mental challenges and this is my favorite way to do it. I also really enjoy music and I listen to it nearly every day. Lastly, I enjoy playing disc golf. </p>
